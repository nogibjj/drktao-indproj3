# Individual Project 3
The purpose of this project is to build upon the Databricks data pipeline that was constructed in mini-project 11. This repository contains multiple Databricks notebooks that perform ETL operations, as well as querying and visualizing the transformed data. In the process, I also conduct a data validation step to ensure that the data was successfully transformed and queried. Spark SQL was used to effectively transform the data and prepare it for analysis. Below I have displayed the main data transformation and visualization step contained within the notebook.
